Market Basket Analysis Macro: The “Poor Man’s Recommendation Engine”

Market basket analysis is a common mathematical technique used by
marketing professionals to reveal affinities between individual products
or product groupings. Clario Analytics has prepared an
open source SAS Market Basket Analysis Macro and made it [available for
download](https://github.com/clarioanalytics/marketbasket/archive/master.zip). The macro was the basis for a
[paper](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi28/223-28.pdf) presented during the SAS
Users International Group in 2003.
